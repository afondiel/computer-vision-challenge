## Overview

Real-time 2D/3D object detection projects using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a deep learning model that can detect and classify objects in images and videos.
- `*`: v3, v5, v8 to the lastest version

## Requirements:

```
- Python
- PyTorch
- YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv8: repository (we will clone this from GitHub)
- OpenCV for video processing
- Google Colab for running the code
``` 

## Implementation Steps:

```
1. Setup Environment
2. Clone YOLOv5 Repository
3. Install Dependencies
4. Load Pre-trained YOLOv5 Model
5. Perform Object Detection on Images
6. Perform Object Detection on Videos
7. Step-by-Step Implementation:
```
