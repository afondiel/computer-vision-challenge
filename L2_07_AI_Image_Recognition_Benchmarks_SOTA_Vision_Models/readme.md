# L2-07: AI Image Recognition Benchmarks with SOTA Vision Models

## Overview

This project benchmarks State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Vision Models for a variety of image recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

### Core Image Recognition Tasks

| **Core Image Recognition Tasks** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|--|--|--|
| Image Classification | Assigns a label to an image. | Classifying an image as "cat" or "dog." |
| Object Detection | Detects and localizes objects in an image. | Detecting cars and pedestrians in a street scene. |
| Semantic Segmentation | Classifies each pixel into a category. | Separating road, sky, and pedestrians in an image. |
| Instance Segmentation | Identifies individual instances of objects and their masks. | Labeling each pedestrian in a crowd separately. |
| Image Captioning | Generates a textual description of an image. | "A dog playing in the park." |
| Action Recognition | Identifies actions in an image or video. | Recognizing someone is "running" or "jumping." |
| Pose Estimation | Estimates joint locations of humans or animals. | Detecting body pose in yoga poses. |

### Advanced Image Recognition Tasks

| **Advanced Image Recognition Tasks** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|--|--|--|
| Image Segmentation (General) | Divides an image into meaningful regions with pixel-level accuracy. | Separating a cat from the background. |
| Depth Estimation | Predicts depth for each pixel in an image. | Estimating distances in a 3D scene. |
| 3D Reconstruction from Images | Reconstructs a 3D model from multiple images. | Building a 3D model of a building from photos. |
| OCR (Optical Character Recognition) | Recognizes and extracts text from images. | Reading a street sign in a photograph. |
| Image Super-Resolution | Enhances the resolution of an image. | Upscaling a low-resolution image to higher resolution. |
| Image Inpainting | Fills in missing or corrupted parts of an image. | Restoring damaged areas in an old photograph. |
| Image Style Transfer | Transfers the style of one image to another. | Applying Van Goghâ€™s painting style to a photo. |

### Video-Based Image Recognition Tasks

| **Video-Based Image Recognition Tasks** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|--|--|--|
| Video Classification | Classifies video sequences based on content. | Identifying a video as "sports" or "news." |
| Object Tracking | Continuously tracks objects across frames. | Following a car in a traffic video. |
| Video Action Recognition | Recognizes actions in a video sequence. | Identifying a soccer player "kicking a ball." |
| Video Segmentation | Performs segmentation across video frames. | Segmenting a moving car from the background. |
| Vision Odometry | Estimates camera motion from a sequence of images. | Estimating a self-driving car's movement. |
| 3D Object Detection from Video | Detects objects and estimates their 3D positions in video. | Detecting pedestrians in a video from a self-driving car. |
| Action Detection | Identifies specific actions or events in a video stream. | Detecting "running" in a surveillance video. |
| Video Captioning | Generates textual descriptions for video content. | "A person is playing guitar in the park." |
| Video Summarization | Creates a condensed version of a video by highlighting key scenes. | Summarizing a 10-minute soccer match into key highlights. |
| Video Prediction | Predicts future frames in a video sequence. | Anticipating the next frame in a moving car video. |

### Specialized Tasks

| **Specialized Tasks** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|--|--|--|
| Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) | Learns features from unlabeled data. | Pretraining a model on large video datasets without labels. |
| Zero-Shot Classification | Classifies new caories not seen during training. | Recognizing new objects in images using CLIP. |
| Multi-Modal Image-Text Analysis | Combines image and text for analysis tasks. | Answering questions about image content. |

### Emerging Research Areas

| **Emerging Research Areas** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|--|--|--|
| Multi-Modal Learning | Combines visual data with other modalities like text or sound. | Combining video and audio for sentiment analysis. |
| Few-Shot Learning | Learns to recognize new classes from few labeled examples. | Training on a new animal species with just a few images. |
