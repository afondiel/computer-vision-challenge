# L1 - 02: Image Classification using ConvNets on CIFAR 10 

## Overview

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of different types of objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Requirements:

```
- Python
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- CIFAR-10 dataset
- Google Colab for running the code
```

## Implementation Steps:

```
1. Load and Explore the CIFAR-10 Dataset
2. Preprocess the Data
3. Build the CNN Model
4. Compile the Model
5. Train the Model
6. Evaluate the Model
7. Make Predictions
```

## Usage

Please run the [notebook](./notebooks/) to see the results.
